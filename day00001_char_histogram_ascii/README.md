## Day 00001 - Char Histogram (ASCII)

**Folder / Rust package:** `day00001_char_histogram_ascii`

### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Write a program that reads a single line of text from standard input and counts how many times each letter (Aâ€“Z or aâ€“z) appears. The program should treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same and ignore all non-letter characters.

Only the letters that appear at least once should be printed, and each should be followed by a number of asterisks (`*`) representing its frequency.

---

### âœ… Requirements

- Input: a single line of text
- Case-insensitive (e.g., `A` and `a` are treated the same)
- Ignore non-alphabetic characters (no digits, punctuation, or `Ã±`)
- Output should include:
  - One line per letter used
  - Format: `letter: *****`
  - Sorted alphabetically by letter

---

### ðŸ“¥ Example Input

```bash
Hello, World!
```

### ðŸ“¤ Expected Output

```bash
d: *
e: *
h: *
l: ***
o: **
r: *
w: *
```

### ðŸŒŸ Bonus Challenge

- Sort the output by frequency (descending) instead of alphabetical order.
- Display total character count and total unique letters used.
